# Bruce Wayne ↔ Batman Toggle UI

## Description
This project demonstrates a state-based UI that switches between
Bruce Wayne and Batman using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

A LEGO-style character is created using pure CSS without images.
The interface toggles between light and dark modes while keeping
characters in fixed spatial positions.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation)

## Features
- Light/Dark mode switching
- Animated LEGO-style avatars
- State-based visibility control
- Clean separation of concerns

## How It Works
The toggle button changes the body class between `bruce` and `batman`.
CSS selectors respond to this state to update the UI and animations.
